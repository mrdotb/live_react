# Development

The easiest way to get started with development is to clone live_react and run the examples

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrdotb/live_react.git
cd live_react_examples
```

The examples include demonstrations of the Link component for LiveView navigation at `/link-demo` and `/link-usage`.
